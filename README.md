<h1>Pac-Man</h1>
<p>This is my take on the 1980s classic Pac-Man arcase game.</p>

<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>Pac-Man was one of my favorite ever games to play growing up. I wanted to re create the arcade/ Nintendo 64 game that I always enjoyed playing, on a computer so that I can enjoy it now as an adult at my leisure.</p>

<h1>Code style</h1>
<p>Stared with HTML to build out the modals, then to CSS and JS simultaneously to style and get buttons functioning. Once I did this, I started on the game itself. First, I built out the maze, then onto the Pac-Man, pellets, and then the ghosts.</p>

<h1>Tech/framework used</h1>
<p>Built using Visual Studio Code, HTML with canvas, CSS, JS, and a tutoriral from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IMXpp3rohQ">here.</a></p>

<h1>Features</h1>
<p>Two player game using arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate the Pac-Man through the maze</p>
